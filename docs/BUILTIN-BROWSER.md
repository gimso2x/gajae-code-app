# Built-in browser contract

The built-in browser replaces the app-managed Chromium sidecar for basic browser
automation. It is available only in the macOS desktop app. Web and self-hosted
clients hand web links to the external browser.

## Choice and availability

The application choice is `builtin`, `aside`, or `ego` (default `builtin`). A
stored legacy `native` value reads as `builtin`; new writes use only the new
names. Built-in explicitly selects the runtime's native browser setting on each
run. Aside and ego keep their CLI probes, routing and no-fallback failure
behavior.

Rust reports actual built-in availability through authenticated automation
status. If capability is absent, the app removes both its browser custom tool
and the SDK browser tool name, so ordinary chat remains usable and a browser
direct browser API request receives an explicit unsupported result instead of
activating the SDK's Chromium implementation. Hidden tool discovery is also
disabled under the app's existing tool allowlist policy.

## Separate manual and chat-link surfaces

Settings has an explicit **Open browser** action for the app's built-in browser
window. It is independent of the selected GJC backend: the selected session
owns the window, or the selected project's `project-<projectId>` scope is used
when no session is selected. Changing the agent backend therefore does not
redirect this manual action.

Absolute HTTP(S) links in chat Markdown always go to the user's external
browser. They never open the built-in window merely because the Tauri bridge is
present, and they do not follow the selected agent backend. In the desktop app
the server hands these links to the operating system opener; in a regular web
browser they use a new browser tab.

## Surface and ownership

One `builtin-browser` window has one owner. An attempt by another session while
it remains open fails as `builtin_browser_in_use`; closing the window releases
ownership. The trusted 56 logical-pixel toolbar (`builtin-controls`) and the
unprivileged remote page child share that one native window through Tauri 2.11.5
with the exact-pinned `unstable` feature that exposes `add_child`.

The supported actions are open/close, navigate, back, forward, reload, observe,
extract, selector-based click and fill. Arbitrary page `run`, screenshots,
frame streaming, input forwarding and multiple tabs are intentionally absent.
Each command carries the expected window/document/origin captured before any
permission prompt, preventing approval from authorizing a later navigation.
An isolated WKContentWorld holds a private per-document identity. The native
state remains loading until that identity is installed in the finished page;
even a reload at the same URL invalidates earlier document authority. DOM
actions verify this identity immediately before accessing the page. Observed
selectors are unique, ambiguous click/fill requests are rejected, and text/HTML
previews are bounded in UTF-8 with explicit truncation metadata.

Navigation permits HTTPS and exact loopback HTTP only. It rejects the app's own
server origin, credentials and special schemes. macOS 13 uses an explicit
ephemeral profile; macOS 14+ uses a persistent UUID profile.

## Boundary and lifecycle

The worker reaches `AutomationService` through the existing bridge. The server
then verifies the native endpoint's HMAC proof; native separately checks the
server's kernel `LOCAL_PEERPID`. Desktop bootstrap uses one private stdin
`GJC_DESKTOP_INIT` v2 envelope, with an optional updater binding. A retained open
window blocks restart preparation. Owner and pending work are retired only
after the window is confirmed destroyed.
Fences, cancellation and physical pending work remain owned until confirmed
settled.

## Packaging and acceptance

Root Puppeteer dependencies are removed, but the pinned SDK still brings
`puppeteer-core` and `@puppeteer/browsers`. Keep the extract-zip backport,
runtime manifest checks and payload security graph until that dependency graph
changes; this contract does not claim that packaged Puppeteer bytes are gone.

## Validation — 2026-09-12

The integrated change was checked on **macOS 26.6.2, arm64**, using an isolated
`--qa-profile` and a disposable loopback website. No production profile or model
credentials were used.

- The full `npm run verify` gate passed, including the real SDK contract suites,
  browserless root/delegation discovery checks, origin permission binding,
  frontend DOM suites, locale parity and package checks. Final typecheck, lint
  and identity checks also passed after cleanup.
- The macOS server payload built and passed its out-of-tree smoke. The final
  native suite passed **358 tests** with 6 existing opt-in cases ignored; the
  build-binding integration suite passed **11 tests**. An ad-hoc app was built
  with `GJC_UPDATE_MODE=disabled`.
- **30 real authenticated REST → server → native WebView checks passed**:
  readiness, opening/loading, title, bounded long Korean-page observation,
  truncation, unique selectors, fill and its input event, click and its page
  handler, ambiguous-selector rejection, remote IPC denial, owner collision,
  navigation, stale-document rejection, native back/forward/reload, same-URL
  reload invalidation and fresh observation, all three loopback
  aliases for the forbidden app server, removed input endpoint, close and the
  confirmed empty state.
- Actual GUI checks passed for Settings launch, the full toolbar below the
  titlebar, address-field navigation, direct page typing/clicking, visible
  blocked-address feedback, toolbar close and normal QA app quit. Geometry
  uses AppKit's content layout and parent coordinate system; the toolbar and
  its status row fit inside 56 points without covering the page.

The native document, cancellation, retained-window restart fence, profile/QA
isolation and capability invariants also have focused Rust tests. A synthetic
updater exchange peer now stays alive until retirement, matching the real
persistent channel and avoiding an early-EOF race in that test fixture.

This is source/ad-hoc acceptance. It does not claim a new live-model browser
run, physical macOS 13 execution, or a signed/notarized production update.
