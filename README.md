Gajae Code App is a self-hosted web and desktop interface for [Gajae Code](https://github.com/devswha/gajae-code). It drives the agent through the runtime's own SDK in an isolated worker, shows every turn as it happens, and puts a review loop between the agent's edits and your next message — on a machine you control, with credentials that never leave it.

- **Sessions with a state** — running, waiting for your answer, finished unread, or failed; a Work section lists what needs a look across every project, and the model titles each session from its first message.
- **The work, folded** — a turn's tool calls collapse into one block with a live status row; three output densities; Stop or Esc ends a turn, a message sent mid-turn steers it.
- **Permissions that ask** — commands and destructive edits wait for approval by default; each project picks Ask, Auto-approve edits or Bypass, plus an always-allow list.
- **A Changes tab, not a git GUI** — the working tree as a diff, a Last-turn scope for what the session just edited, and line comments that become the next message. Git stays the agent's job.
- **Browser choices** — macOS desktop sessions can use the built-in system-WebView browser; web/self-host sessions use external links or the user's Aside setup.
- **Every viewer** — a second tab or a phone on the LAN sees the same live run; the layout goes down to a phone screen.

## Quick Start

**macOS (Apple Silicon, macOS 13+) — the desktop app.** Download the DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/devswha/gajae-code-app/releases/latest), verify it, drag it to Applications, open it. Since v2.0.0-beta.7 the image is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple; Gatekeeper opens it like any other app.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
shasum -a 256 -c gajae-app-desktop-2.0.0-beta.7-macos-arm64.dmg.sha256
```

**Linux server (x86_64, glibc 2.35+, Node.js 22) — self-host the web UI.** Unpack the server archive, run it as a per-user systemd service, reach it through a browser over an SSH tunnel or VPN.

```bash
sha256sum --check gajae-app-server-2.0.0-beta.7-linux-x64-node22.tar.gz.sha256
```

Install, upgrade and rollback steps: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) · [docs/SELF-HOST.md](docs/SELF-HOST.md).

**Linux desktop (x86_64) — build from source.** Native Tauri `.deb` and `.AppImage`
packages bundle Node.js **22.22.2** and Bun **1.4.0**. See the
[Linux desktop guide](docs/DESKTOP-LINUX.md) for prerequisites, local builds,
installation, and package checks. Linux desktop downloads are not yet published;
the separate Linux desktop CI workflow produces build artifacts for validation.
CI is configured to build on Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35) and check extracted
packages on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04; those jobs have not yet run. Local Ubuntu
24.04 validation uses glibc 2.39 and does not establish Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility.

**From source — Node.js 22.x (22.22.2+), Rust, Bun 1.4.0.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devswha/gajae-code-app.git
cd gajae-code-app
npm ci
node scripts/fetch-bun.mjs          # the pinned Bun the GJC worker runs on
npm run dev                         # server :3001, client :5173
npm run desktop:dev                 # the same, inside the Tauri desktop shell
```

The app uses the models, presets, skills and credentials of the Gajae Code installation in `~/.gjc`, and you can sign in to providers from inside the app. Linux desktop development requires the system libraries listed in the Linux guide. Intel Mac, Windows and Linux arm64 desktop builds are not available yet.

## Permission Modes

The runtime's own gate defaults to *allow*; the app does not. Every project has a persisted mode, set from the composer or Settings → Permissions, and an always-allow list that the permission card's **Always allow** fills.

| Mode | Runs without asking | Waits for approval |
|---|---|---|
| **Ask** (default) | Reads, searches, and file writes and edits the runtime does not gate | Commands (`bash`, `eval`), file deletes and moves — everything the runtime gates |
| **Auto-approve edits** | The above, plus every file mutation (`edit`, `write`, `delete`, `move`) | Commands |
| **Bypass** | Everything | Nothing — for a scratch project you trust the agent with |

A card answered in one tab closes in every other viewer. Always deny is offered when the runtime offers it and holds for the run.

## Facts

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Gajae Code SDK 0.15.6 on Bun 1.4.0, bundled, driven in an isolated worker; prompts pass through an owner-readable temp file, never a process argument |
| **Where things live** | Database, assets and cache under `~/.gajae-app`; transcripts stay in the runtime's own session files and are never copied into the app's database |
| **Network** | Loopback by default and fail-closed (it can run shell commands); cross-origin callers are rejected on HTTP and WebSocket |
| **Trust boundary** | One owner: whoever reaches the server is the owner, so the network is the boundary — loopback, a tailnet, or a proxy that authenticates in front. Managed worktrees run git without the system or user gitconfig; a checkout filter in a repository's own `.git/config` (git-lfs is one) still runs, the same trust `git status` places in a checkout you opened |
| **Stack** | React 19 · Vite 7 · Tailwind 4 · Express · SQLite · a Rust core · Tauri 2 for the desktop shell |
| **Gate** | `npm run verify` — audit, typecheck, Rust core, tests, lint, identity check, build |
| **License** | MIT since v2.0.0-beta.7 (earlier betas AGPL-3.0) |
