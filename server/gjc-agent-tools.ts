/**
 * Which of the runtime's builtin tools this app turns on.
 *
 * `@gajae-code/coding-agent` owns the builtin registry. The adapter substitutes
 * app-owned task/subagent implementations and automation transports for the
 * selected names. Every current registry entry must appear in exactly one
 * list below; the partition test makes an upstream addition deliberate.
 *
 * An allowlist is right here, unlike the command catalog: a tool carries real
 * cost or reach (extra model calls, a spawned browser, an SSH connection, a
 * message leaving the machine), so silence should mean off. The drift test
 * covers the other direction — a name that stops existing upstream fails
 * loudly instead of being quietly dropped.
 *
 * Enabling a tool whose output has nowhere to appear is only half an enable,
 * so each entry below is one the app can already show: every tool call renders
 * through the chat's tool card, including via the Default config.

  // a browser session invokes them at all.

  // session, and it makes multi-step work legible in the transcript.

  // The adapter replaces these names through the public CustomTool API and
  // excludes the SDK builtins. App children inherit policy/model/credentials,
  // remain owned by their calling transcript and end with the owner's turn.

  // Structural code search. Read-only, and materially better than regex on
  // real refactors.

  // Executes a named project-runner task through the same BashTool result
  // shape, which the generic tool card already renders. It is explicit rather
  // than arriving incidentally from recipe.enabled when bash is present.

  // Definitions, references and types. Degrades to nothing when the project
  // has no language server, so the downside is an unused tool.

  // returns a not-configured result when there are none.

  // built-in browser actions use the same native WebView while native
  // application actions stay behind CUA Driver.
