 * runtime defines it.
 *
 * The registry was keyed by Claude Code's names instead (Bash, Read, Grep,
 * Glob, TodoWrite), so every GJC tool call missed it and rendered as a raw
 * JSON dump through `Default`. Nothing failed; the cards just quietly went
 * generic. This is the test that would have caught it.
 *
 * A bun test because the runtime cannot be imported from node.
 *
 * Lives outside the `server/gjc-*` namespace on purpose. It asserts an
 * *application* claim - that the chat tool cards are keyed the way the runtime
 * names its tools - so it belongs with the application when the engine moves to
 * its own repository. Under the engine's name it would have travelled with the
 * engine and taken an import of `src/` with it.
