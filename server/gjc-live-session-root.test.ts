 * These files are the conversation itself. They lived under `os.tmpdir()`,
 * which macOS reaps on its own schedule: 73 app-started sessions lost their
 * transcripts in one sweep while their database rows survived, so the sidebar
 * kept listing sessions that opened empty and stayed that way.
 *
 * The root therefore has to sit with the app's other durable state. A future
 * change that sends it back to a temp directory should fail here rather than
 * in a user's history weeks later.
