# GJC live provider specification

Status: Production Bun SDK worker, native host/watcher, durable jobs, and native
PTY slices implemented (updated 2026-09-01)

GJC is the only provider routed through an isolated provider worker. Claude,
Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode retain their existing execution paths.

## Headless GJC contract

Production starts the pinned Bun runtime and `server/gjc-bun-worker.ts` behind
the native core. The worker creates `@gajae-code/coding-agent` sessions through
`server/gjc-bun-sdk-adapter.ts`; it does not spawn the `gjc` CLI.

- `cwd` is the selected project path.
- Prompts cross the private worker protocol on stdin and are passed to the SDK
  in process. They are never placed on a process command line.
- Authentication and configuration come from the user's normal GJC
  configuration; the worker verifies the bundled runtime manifest before
  creating a session.
- Application/worker traffic is byte-bounded NDJSON. Worker stderr is
  diagnostic only and is not forwarded to browser clients as raw provider
  output.
- Controlled questions, approvals, steering, usage, OAuth, and abort are owned
  by the SDK adapter. Production has no CLI or loopback-side-channel fallback.

## Production boundary

### Application process

`server/gjc-worker-client.ts` is the only production GJC execution facade used
by `server/index.js` and `server/routes/agent.js`. It owns:

- one lazily started, long-lived native-core and worker generation;
- application session scope and immutable run IDs;
- browser-facing normalized events, replay sequencing, and provider-session
  persistence through `ChatSessionWriter`;
- the synchronous mirror of pending controlled questions;
- run notifications and explicit failed-turn fallback;
- generation restart, request timeout isolation, graceful shutdown, and
  process-tree escalation.
- one supervised native GJC transcript watcher with bounded restart backoff.

There is no direct in-process or direct-Node-worker production fallback. A
missing or failed native core, malformed output, or worker exit fails active GJC
runs explicitly; a later run starts a fresh generation only after cleanup is
proven.

### Native core process

`native/gajae-core` is a minimal Rust runtime with two strict modes. The
application starts `dist-native/gajae-core -- <worker>` to host exactly one
trusted Node worker without a shell, and starts `dist-native/gajae-core watch`
for GJC transcript changes. In process-host mode, the core:

- inherits the application-controlled environment and working directory;
- forwards application stdin to worker stdin without interpreting Protocol v1;
- gives the worker byte-transparent stdout/stderr pipes and waits for its exit;
- propagates deterministic child exit status and emits only fixed diagnostics;
- has no listener, database, provider logic, persistence, or independent restart
  policy.

Source development builds the core before startup. Release artifacts contain the
host-native executable and do not require an installed Rust toolchain. Failure to
build, locate, or launch the core is fail-closed; Node never launches the worker
directly.

### Native GJC session watcher

`server/modules/providers/services/gjc-session-watcher.service.ts` starts
`gajae-core watch` over the persisted `~/.gjc/agent/sessions` root and the
configured live-session root before the initial provider scan. The watcher:

- rejects missing, relative, duplicate, symlink, or non-directory roots;
- attaches all roots recursively before emitting its exact ready frame;
- canonicalizes event targets and emits only UTF-8 `.jsonl` `add`/`change` paths
  whose resolved filesystem identity remains inside a configured root over a strict
  64 KiB Protocol 1 NDJSON stream;
- uses bounded native and Node queues, serial cancellable callback delivery, fixed
  path-free diagnostics, and stdin EOF for owner shutdown;
- restarts with bounded exponential backoff, runs a GJC-only reconciliation after
  each replacement is ready, and never falls back to a Node/Chokidar GJC watcher.

The existing GJC TypeScript synchronizer remains responsible for defense-in-depth
realpath containment, subagent filtering, JSONL parsing, session database upserts,
and browser `session_upserted` events. Claude, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode retain
their existing Chokidar watchers unchanged.

### Native job authority

`gajae-core jobs --database <absolute-path>` is a separate strict 64 KiB
Protocol 1 NDJSON API and the single state-machine authority for durable jobs.
Its state and ordered event replay persist in a dedicated Rust-owned SQLite
database built with bundled SQLite. Rust exclusively owns its version table and
sequential migrations; Node must not open this database. Invalid paths, unknown
schema versions, migration failures, or corrupt state fail closed. Explicit
transitions remain fenced by monotonically generated owner leases, and startup
reconciliation moves persisted active jobs to `interrupted`. Native Git/worktree
APIs, the TypeScript `JobOrchestrator`, and its admission saga are landed
components only: production GJC execution remains on the single-turn worker
facade. Automatic capacity dispatch, multi-turn continuity, and branch/PR work
from managed worktrees are deferred to Slice 3. Worker Protocol v1 and all React
behavior are unchanged.

### Native PTY lifecycle

`gajae-core pty -- <program> [args...]` owns exactly one native PTY child and
launches it directly without shell interpretation. Its separate Protocol 1
NDJSON control stream is capped at 64 KiB per frame; binary input/output uses
bounded base64 payloads, resize dimensions are validated, and output, exit,
stdin EOF cleanup, and explicit shutdown are observable. The existing
browser-shell `node-pty` path has not moved in this slice, so React and current
terminal behavior remain unchanged.

### Worker process

`server/gjc-bun-worker.ts` is the private production executable.
`server/gjc-worker.ts` supplies its protocol host. Together with
`server/gjc-bun-sdk-adapter.ts`, they own:

- bundled runtime verification and SDK session creation;
- authentication, OAuth, controlled asks, approvals, steering, usage, and
  abort;
- start/resume completion ordering and provider-session discovery;
- draining or aborting active runs when shutdown, stdin EOF, or protocol failure
  occurs.

The worker does not own or mutate application database, browser WebSocket,
replay, or notification state.

### Identity model

Three IDs are intentionally separate:

1. `appSessionId` is the stable Gajae Code App session and protocol scope.
2. `runId` is generated for every start/resume request and is the immutable
   abort/event correlation handle.
3. `providerSessionId` is the native GJC session used for resume and history.

Every run event carries `sessionId: appSessionId` in the envelope and `runId` in
its payload. `session.created` adds `providerSessionId`. Late events for an old
run are ignored even when a new run reuses the same application session.

## Protocol v1

`server/gjc-worker-protocol.ts` is the source of truth. Transport is private
stdio NDJSON with a strict 64 MiB maximum frame size.

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "kind": "request",
  "id": "run-or-request-id",
  "sessionId": "application-session-id",
  "method": "session.start",
  "payload": {}
}
```

The full method list, session scoping, error codes, lifecycle and conformance
rules are specified in [docs/GJC-WORKER-PROTOCOL.md](../docs/GJC-WORKER-PROTOCOL.md),
which is written so either side can be implemented from it alone.

That document is checked against the code by
`server/gjc-worker-protocol-spec.test.ts`. This section deliberately no longer
repeats the method list: the copy that used to live here had gone stale, listing
neither `turn.steer` nor any `oauth.*` method, which is what an unchecked second
copy does.

App-owned delegation settlement rides this protocol as the scoped event
`delegation.updated`, emitted once per settled child after its durable
`gajae-app.delegation.v1` receipt is flushed to the owner transcript. The event
carries only the public snapshot (`delegationId`, `status`, `agent`,
`description`, `executionMode`, `repositoryBinding`); the transcript receipt
projection is what restores the same rows after a reload, per
`docs/plans/delegation-lifecycle-contract.md` §10-11.

The codec rejects unknown fields, methods, unsafe identifiers, incompatible
versions, invalid JSON values, mismatched responses, oversized or unterminated
frames, and unknown response IDs. Pending requests fail when the worker exits.
Diagnostics and protocol errors use fixed safe text; supplied secrets are
redacted recursively by the serializer.

## Tool permissions

The runtime gates `bash`, `monitor`, `eval`, `delete`, `move` and destructive
`edit` intents behind `AgentSession.setSdkPermissionMode` /
`setSdkPermissionProvider`. Its SDK default is `allow`, so a session the app
does not configure runs those tools unprompted.

The application decides per project and the worker enforces. No protocol
method or frame changes; the policy travels inside existing payloads:

- `session.start` / `session.resume` options may carry
  `permissions: { mode: 'ask' | 'auto_edits' | 'bypass', allowAlways: string[] }`
  (`server/gjc-permission-policy.ts`). When present the adapter switches the
  session to `prompt` and installs `server/gjc-bun-permission-gate.ts`; when
  absent the runtime default stands. A malformed block fails the run with the
  application error code `invalid_permissions` — a start failure whose cause
  the app itself produced — and the application relays the fixed text
  "Invalid GJC run permissions." to the client instead of the generic
  "GJC worker failed.".
- A run's model must pair with a credential the runtime can use. Stored rows
  pin deterministically as before; a provider with **no** stored row is still
  eligible when the auth layer can resolve a key for it (`models.yml`
  `apiKey`/`apiKeyEnv`, env fallback — probed via `peekApiKey`, which resolves
  nothing), and such a run starts with no `credentialSelector` so the runtime
  authenticates the provider itself, exactly as the CLI does. When nothing
  resolves — a default role pointing at a provider nobody can sign in to, or a
  pinned model on one — the run fails with the application error code
  `model_unresolved` (`server/gjc-model-resolution.ts`) and the application
  relays the fixed text "The GJC model could not be resolved. Check the model
  selection and provider sign-in, then try again.".
- A call the policy covers (`bypass`, a tool on `allowAlways`, or a file
  mutation under `auto_edits`) is approved inside the worker and recorded once
  per tool per run as a `system_notice` ("Auto-approved bash (always allow)").
  The browser omits these routine info lines when projecting chat rows; raw
  records and permission handling are unchanged. Other info notices, warnings,
  errors, and actual approval requests remain visible.
  No permission request crosses to the host, so the run is never reported as awaiting input.
- The runtime's `priority` notice for a rejected fast mode ("Priority/fast mode
  rejected for this model; retried without it. Fast mode is off for this model
  until you re-enable it with /fast on.") is omitted from chat rows the same
  way, at any level and with or without the `priority: ` source prefix. The
  turn already ran without priority, the app exposes no fast-mode control, and
  the runtime re-warns once per model in every session. The notice is still
  recorded, exported and forwarded; only the chat row is dropped. Any other
  wording, including a different source prefix or extra text, stays visible.
- Any other gated call is an `ask.presented` event whose message is a
  `permission_request` with `requestId` prefixed `sdk-permission:`, the
  runtime's `toolName`, its `rawInput` as `input`, and a `context` naming the
  runtime option kinds. `ask.reply` answers it with
  `decision: { allow: boolean, always?: boolean }`; `always` maps to the
  runtime's `allow_always` option for the rest of that run, and the application
  persists it to the project's allow-list before forwarding the reply.
- `ask` questions keep their `sdk-ask:` prefix and answer semantics.

The app-owned browser and computer tool wrappers receive the same validated
run permission mode as the SDK gate. In `bypass`, target/origin resolution still
runs, but the extra access question is omitted without adding grants to either
allow-list. Ask and auto-edits retain their existing access prompts. This does
not auto-answer `ask` questions or override native readiness, OS permissions,
or CUA driver restrictions. The mode is captured for the run; no
implicit grant survives into a later Ask run.

## Browser backend

The runtime owns the browser backend contract: its `browser.backend` setting
(`native` | `aside`, default `native`) decides whether its built-in browser tool
is exposed and whether its `<browser-backend>` Aside routing block is appended
to the system prompt (`@gajae-code/coding-agent/browser-backend`). With `aside`
the runtime routes every rendered/authenticated browser task through the
user-installed Aside CLI via its Bash tool and tells the model to load the
user-installed `aside` skill; the app adds no Aside tool, prompt, skill, MCP
server or repl/exec policy of its own.

The application stores the choice (`automation.browserBackend.v1`,
`GET`/`PUT /api/automation/browser-backend`) and the worker enforces it. No
protocol method or frame changes; the value travels inside existing payloads:

- `session.start` / `session.resume` options carry the server-resolved
  `browserBackend: 'builtin' | 'aside' | 'ego'` and `builtinBrowserAvailable`
  boolean.
  `enrichGjcSdkRunOptions` overwrites both client fields: the backend comes from
  the app setting, while availability requires an authenticated
  `automationService.browser.status()` result of
  `{ state: 'ready', ready: true, engine: 'webview' }`. Failure or absence is
  false so non-browser self-hosted chat can still start.
- `builtin` writes `browser.backend=native` on the per-run settings clone. The
  app's WebView transport replaces the runtime tool only when trusted readiness
  is true. Otherwise the adapter removes `browser` from both `automationTools`
  and `toolNames`, preventing the SDK's Puppeteer implementation from appearing
  as a fallback. `computer` and every other allowed tool remain unchanged.
- `aside` first runs the runtime's own Aside CLI discovery (`probeAsideCli`:
  `~/.local/bin/aside`, the `Aside CLI.app` bundle, then `PATH`) and, when it
  finds nothing, fails the run with the application error code
  `aside_unavailable` before any session is created; the application relays
  the fixed text "The Aside CLI was not found, so this session cannot start
  with the Aside browser backend. Install the Aside CLI, or switch Browser
  backend back to Native in Settings > Automation.". Searched paths go to the
  worker diagnostics only. There is no fallback to the native browser.
- When the CLI is found the adapter writes `settings.override('browser.backend',
  'aside')` on the per-run settings clone and withholds the app's `browser`
  automation transport, because the SDK registers a supplied automation tool
  unconditionally, and removes `browser` from `toolNames`. The runtime then
  hides the built-in tool (active and discoverable) and appends its routing
  block; the `computer` transport is unaffected. Delegated children receive the
  already-filtered tool names and automation transports, so they cannot regain
  an unavailable browser.
- `ego` (PoC) is the one backend the runtime does not know, so the app owns
  it end to end (`server/gjc-browser-backend.ts`). The adapter runs the app's
  own probe (`probeEgoBrowserCli`: `~/.local/bin/ego-browser`, then the worker's
  `PATH`) and, when it finds a CLI, pins that resolved absolute path (POSIX
  quoted) in `GJC_EGO_BROWSER_INSTRUCTIONS`. It writes
  `browser.backend=native` (so a user-level runtime Aside setting cannot inject
  the Aside block) and `browser.enabled=false` (so the runtime's built-in tool
  is unavailable even if discovered), withholds the app's `browser` transport,
  removes `browser` from `toolNames`, and appends the app-owned
  `<browser-backend>` block after the app environment note. If the CLI is
  missing, the same disabled state is used with a browser-unavailable policy:
  ordinary chat/coding continues, and the model is forbidden to substitute
  Built-in, Aside, an OS browser, Playwright/Puppeteer/MCP or computer/CUA.
  There is no session-wide `ego_unavailable` failure and no fallback. The
  block routes browser work to Bash → the pinned executable's `nodejs` command
  and tells the model to load the user-installed `ego-browser` skill, which is
  the API reference; the app ships no ego tool, skill copy, MCP server or
  prompt beyond that block.

`GET /api/automation/ego-readiness` runs `probeEgoReadiness` against the real
worker agent directory (`GJC_WORKER_AGENT_DIR`, default `~/.gjc/agent`). The
probe is filesystem-only: it reads CLI/app/skill links and versions, emits the
documented taxonomy and version matrix, and never executes, installs, repairs
or writes. Unknown connectivity, running-app and skew states remain unknown
warnings. `POST /api/automation/ego-readiness/test` is only for an explicit
Settings action; it uses `execFile` with the pinned absolute path, `shell:false`,
a minimal environment and a two-second bound for `--version` followed by the
documented `nodejs -e "console.log('ok')"` round trip. It never invokes
`import`, `upgrade` or `onboarding`.

`GET /api/automation/ego-activity?sessionId=…` is the second and last place the
app may execute the ego CLI. It answers what the agent's browser is doing, from
ego itself: the ego backend routes browser work through Bash, so the runtime
sees only an opaque command, and the CLI buffers the model's own output until
the round ends. The surface is opt-in (`automation.egoActivity.v1`, off by
default) and executes nothing unless the stored backend is `ego`, the platform
supports it and a session id is supplied; Settings reads the opt-in without one.
The observation program (`EGO_ACTIVITY_SCRIPT`) is a fixed constant with no
interpolation, calls only `listTaskSpaces()`, `taskSpace(id)` and `tabs()`, and
yields only agent-created, agent-owned spaces whose name starts with the
app-minted session token (`egoActivityToken`, derived from the app session id
and written into the routing block's naming rule) and, inside them, only
agent-opened managed pages. One execution is shared by every reader inside a
one-second window, URLs are reduced to origin and path, nothing is persisted,
and any failure reports `unavailable` instead of surfacing an error into the
run. The design record is `docs/plans/ego-activity-contract.md`.

`GET /api/automation/ego-activity/frame?sessionId=&space=&page=` answers one
JPEG of a page that session's own Space is showing. It requires a second opt-in
(`automation.egoActivityFrame.v1`, off by default) on top of the activity
surface, and the requested space and page must appear in that session's
attributed snapshot, so a page the session never opened cannot be captured. The
frame program is built by `buildEgoFrameScript`, which interpolates only a
validated positive integer space id and an ego page label (`/^p[0-9]{1,4}$/`)
and refuses anything else; it calls exactly one CDP method,
`Page.captureScreenshot`, at JPEG quality 35 scaled to at most 640px wide, and
returns base64 bytes so no picture of a signed-in browser is ever written to
disk. Non-JPEG payloads and frames above 1 MB are dropped. One capture serves a
page for 900 ms, responses are `no-store`, and a capture that fails (a
minimized ego window produces no compositor frames) answers 404 rather than
retrying.

The Built-in tool exposes only `open`, `close`, and `act`. Its act verbs are
`navigate`, `back`, `forward`, `reload`, `observe`, `extract`, `click`, and
`fill`; click/fill require CSS selectors, and extract accepts an optional
selector and `text`/`html` format. It exposes no evaluation, screenshots,
coordinates, refs, tabs, waits, keys, scrolling, selection, or downloads.
Before every command, the bridge authorizes the target origin and returns the
current `{ windowEpoch, documentEpoch, origin }` binding. The tool sends that
original pre-prompt binding as `payload.expected`; a navigation during the
permission prompt therefore makes native execution reject the stale command
instead of silently retargeting it. `open` carries no expected binding.
- Skill discovery is unchanged: the adapter passes no explicit skill list and
  leaves `skills.enabled` alone, so the runtime scans the project's
  `.gjc/skills` and the agent dir's `skills/` (`~/.gjc/agent/skills` by
  default, the same location the CLI uses) and a user-installed `aside` skill
  is discoverable and loadable through the `skill` tool.

`server/gjc-browser-backend.bun.test.ts` checks the contract against the pinned
runtime with an injected CLI probe and a fixture skill; no Aside installation
is required by any test. The ego seam (probe injected, no ego lite required) is
covered in `server/gjc-sdk-contract.bun.test.ts`, `server/gjc-worker.test.ts`
and `server/gjc-worker-client.test.ts`; see `docs/BROWSER-EGO-POC.md`.

## Process and terminal lifecycle

- On POSIX (Linux and macOS), the application starts the Rust core as a detached
  process-group leader. The Node worker and GJC children inherit that group;
  reaping requires direct-child close and process-group `ESRCH`.
- Windows is a v2 non-target and runtime-frozen per this brief: CI and a
  verified desktop machine are unavailable. No `taskkill /T /F` fallback is
  part of the v2 contract. Windows cleanup is fail-closed as `unconfirmed`, so
  it cannot release a lease or admit a replacement generation.
- `worker.initialize` covers the whole SDK bootstrap (runtime manifest check,
  model registry build, online model discovery), which takes several seconds on
  a loaded machine. The application bounds it at 60 s
  (`DEFAULT_INITIALIZE_TIMEOUT_MS`), separately from the 5 s `worker.shutdown`
  bound; a worker that misses it is reaped and the reason is written to
  `~/.gajae-app/logs/gjc-worker.log` and the server output, while callers see
  the sanitized failure.
- A start/resume response remains pending until the GJC run settles and all
  earlier worker events have been emitted.
- `turn.abort` targets `runId`; the worker time-bounds the SDK attempt before
  direct child-signal fallback. The application marks a run aborted only after
  the worker confirms `aborted: true`; failed or timed-out aborts leave it active.
- Exactly one terminal browser event is forwarded. If the worker dies before
  producing one, the application emits one sanitized error and one failed
  completion.
- Usage enrichment, SDK bridge closure, and installation probes are bounded;
  `complete` remains the final run event even when optional dependencies stall.
- Application shutdown sends `worker.shutdown`, waits for bounded run drain,
  then terminates the owned worker tree.
